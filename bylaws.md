## Resignation

Resignations are effective upon receipt by the Secretary of the Board of a written notification.

## Removal

Election or appointment of an officer, agent, or director shall not of itself create contract rights, and such appointment shall be terminable at will.

## Vacancies

A vacancy in any office because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or otherwise, may be filled by a quorum of the Board for the unexpired portion of the term.

## Election of Directors

The members will elect directors at a meeting designated by the Board as the Society's annual meeting. Vacancies in the Board will be filled by the Board as stated in Section 3(p) below rather than by a vote of the members.

## Regular Meetings

The Board shall have regular meetings at least monthly. Meetings shall be at such dates, times, and places as the Board shall determine. Attendance by directors is required at no less than 8 of the 12 meetings per year (1 per month). At least one Board meeting during a year will be organized as an in-person event.

## Notice of Special Meetings

A special meeting may be called by the Board Chair or at the request of any two (2) directors by notice not less than one week before such meetings. Any directors may waive notice of any meeting. The attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

## Quorum

A majority of the number of elected and acting directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board. If less than such majority is present at a meeting, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. All decisions will be made by the majority vote of those present at a meeting at which a quorum is present. If a Board vote results in a split decision, the Board Chair, if present at the meeting, can decide the issue.

## Participation in Meeting by Conference Telephone

Directors may participate in a meeting through the use of a virtual conference or similar communication solution, so long as members participating in such meetings can hear one another. A quorum must be maintained at all times during the meeting or the meeting will not continue.

## Manner of Acting

The act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board.

## Action Without a Meeting

Any action that may be taken by the Board at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if consent in writing, setting forth the action so to be taken, shall be agreed to before such action by a majority of the directors. Such consent can be provided by Board-approved electronic means, as long as any decisions made through these means are reviewed and recorded in the following Board meeting.

 ## Vacancies

 If the role of President becomes vacant, the Vice President will assume the role of President, vacating the Vice President role (to be filled). Any vacancy occurring in the Board may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum of the Board, unless otherwise provided by law. If there is an equal number of affirmative and negative votes, then the ultimate determination shall be made by the then-sitting President. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of their predecessor in office. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by election by the Board for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the directors.

 ## Employment

 No paid employee can serve on the Board or in the role of officers while they are employed in a paid position by the Society.

 ## Compensation and Reimbursement

 Directors shall serve without compensation with the exception of reimbursed expenses. Reimbursement is allowed for expenses incurred in the furtherance of the Society's business with documentation and prior approval from board quorum.

 ## Presumption of Assent

 A director of the Society who is present at a meeting of the Board at which action on any corporate matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless their dissent shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless he shall file their written dissent to such action with the person acting as the Secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof, or shall forward such dissent to the Secretary of the Societyimmediately after the adjournment of the meeting. Such right to dissent shall not apply to any director who voted in favor of such action.

The Board may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the directors, establish one or more advisory boards or committees. Committees will be held according to all tenets of these Bylaws.

## Local Chapters

A local Society chapter may establish smaller, local chapters within the geographical boundary of a chapter, such as country or a city. The bylaws of a chapter must not contain anything that is at variance with the expressed purposes of the Society or with the Society Bylaws, and must be approved as specified by the Society Board before becoming effective. A chapter may not change its bylaws, its name, or its boundaries without approval as specified by the Society. Chapter bylaws may be produced in the native language of a nation, but must be translated into English for submission to the Society.

The Society may, by an affirmative vote of a majority of the directors, suspend or annul a chapter if, in the judgment of the Board, such action is in the best interests of the Society.

# Indemnity

Subject to the limitations in this Section 6, the Society provides indemnification to directors, officers, and employees as required by Minnesota Statutes Chapter 317A (currently in Section 317A.521). Pursuant to Section 317A.521 Subd. 4, in addition to other applicable limitations, the Society's duty to provide indemnification or advances of expenses will be limited to providing insurance to cover the Society's duty unless the Board determines the Society will provide indemnification or advances of expenses apart from coverage provided by insurance. The Board will decide whether and how the Society will provide insurance based on the availability, coverage, and cost of insurance, and other factors the Board deems relevant. In an action by the Board to provide indemnification or advances of expenses apart from coverage provided by insurance, Board action will be by a majority of a quorum and directors who are at the time parties to the proceeding will not be counted for determining a majority or the presence of a quorum.

# Conflicts Of Interest

## Conflict defined

A conflict of interest may exist when any director, officer, or staff member may be seen as having interests that are adverse to the interests of the Society.

Prior to any vote of the Board, a conflict of interest statement shall be made by any director who is aware of any potential conflicts of interest to ensure that all parties are aware of any such conflicts.

## Disclosure required

Any conflict of interest shall be disclosed to the Board by the person concerned. When any conflict of interest is relevant to a matter requiring action by the Board, the interested person shall call it to the attention of the Board or its appropriate committee and such person shall not vote on the matter; provided, however, any director disclosing a possible conflict of interest may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board or a committee thereof.

## Absence from discussion

The person having the conflict shall not participate in the decision regarding the matter under consideration.

## Minutes

The minutes of the meeting of the Board or committee shall reflect that the conflict of interest was disclosed and that the interested person did not vote. When there is doubt as to whether a conflict of interest exists, the matter shall be resolved by a vote of the Board or its committee, excluding the vote of the person concerning whose situation the doubt has arisen.

## Annual review

A copy of this conflict of interest statement shall be furnished to each director, officer, and staff member who is presently serving the Board of the Society, or who may hereafter become associated with the Society.
